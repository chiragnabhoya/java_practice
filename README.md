# Java Practice Project

## Description
This repository contains various Java practice programs, covering topics such as object-oriented programming, multithreading, GUI development (AWT), file handling, and more. It is intended for learning and experimenting with core Java concepts.

## Project Structure
The project includes multiple Java files, each demonstrating different programming concepts. Below are some key files:

- **ArrObj.java**: Demonstrates working with arrays of objects.
- **AWTExample1.java**: A simple Java AWT GUI example.
- **Bank.java**: Implements basic banking operations.
- **ExBank.java**: An extended banking example.
- **MultiLevelIn.java**: Demonstrates multilevel inheritance in Java.
- **MyBufferedReader.java**: Shows how to use BufferedReader for input handling.
- **MyCallvalue.java**: Example demonstrating call by value.
- **MyclassVariable.java**: Illustrates the use of class variables in Java.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) (version 8 or later)
- A Java-compatible IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or VS Code) or a terminal
